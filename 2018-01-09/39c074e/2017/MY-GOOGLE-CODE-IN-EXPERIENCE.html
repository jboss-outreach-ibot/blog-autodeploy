  <section class="post-content"><h2 id="my-google-code-in-experience">MY GOOGLE CODE-IN EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>Google code-in is a world-wide competition held by the folks at Google annually which provides a platform for us to explore new and interesting organisations and also help them! With tasks in all branches of cyber-computing such as: Code, User Interface, Documentation/Training, Quality Assurance and Outreach/Research it is the ultimate competition.</p>

<p>I found about GCI from a friend a year ago but I was too late to join in the fun. Now that I know how epic Google Code-in is, I really regret not being able to participate last year. Nevertheless, this year I have planned to complete as many GCI tasks as I can and not waste this opportunity.</p>

<p>The mentors are a great addition to the competition. Without them, I probably wouldn’t have any successful submissions. They really do help a lot and narrow the tasks down for us to understand it. No matter how wrong the first draft is or even the tenth draft. They keep on providing their services relentlessly. Their motivational chat-bits also keep us focus and regulate the ginormous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The best thing about GCI is that it motivates us to surf the internet and learn to do things previously unheard-of. For example; Forking a Project in GitHub. It was something which I at first hearing about, thought of food but later I understood what it really was and how relevant it is. Never would this be possible had GCI not existed. The JBoss community can help me in this completion by introducing more tasks for me to accomplish so that I reach their leaderboard. It would be a great honour.</p>

<p>The first task is where the fear lies. After that it becomes your passion as it did for me. I remember my peers bragging about the number of tasks they completed last year and truthfully I was overwhelmed. How could a child of my age complete so many tasks in a world renowned completion I asked myself but now as I am a part of GCI just as much as they are.</p>

<p>I used to constantly switch tabs between the problem, the procedure and help tabs that the google search engine helpfully provided me. Trying to piece together the solution and deciphering the answer to every problem really makes you feel alive. One after the other, slowly but surely each sub-problem I knocked out of the equation.</p>

<p>When I completed my first task, I was hocked on to it like an anchor. I was the best experience by far. I had actually accomplished something and in doing so also benefited an actual organisation. That feeling is like no other. Soon I started to hunt for a second and a third. The third meant that I would get a google t-shirt from as a prize. I was psyched! I must admit I wasn’t the fastest to reach so far but I was defiantly determined and disciplined for the task. Day and night, I emptied the internet, disburdening it of its information and piecing together information to finish the task. ASAP!</p>
