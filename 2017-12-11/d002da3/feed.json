But I didn’t found the right platform to work. But one day I heard about Google Code-In from one of my friend. I gathered information about it from my friends and internet and later decided to participate in the contest.\n\nThe day when Google Code-In started-\n\nFirst day was quite exciting. As it was my first time, I decided to go with a simple task. The level of the task is quite variant so that everyone can participate and solve based on their skills. First day it took me a little time to search through the list of all organisation and decide one. Finally, I decided to go with Jboss community for their logo designing task.\n\nWhy I choose Jboss Community-\n\nFrom the very first day, Jboss community emerges to be the best organisation. I scroll through its tasks and found quite a few that were matching my domain and interest. Although, here competition is quite high but still I preferred to go with it. Also, mentors are very supportive and have helped me in guiding through various problems where I got stuck. Tasks are reviewed in few hours as comparison to the other organisations.\n\nWhat I hope to learn in this program-\n\nI hope that being a participant in this international level program will not only enhance my skills but will also boost up my confidence. As I have never been a part of such contests, so I have learnt many new things including how one should approach a mentor, discuss problems with them and how to work on GitHub. I got to learn many cool stuff like creating CSS animation, logos, working with Java script and many more. I hope I’ll make it to leaderboard this year and contribute my best to open-source.\n",

Having been a part of several open-source activities previously, I’ve learnt plenty from my past experiences. I believe that Google Code-In will be no exception.\n\nFast forward several weeks and over a dozen tasks, I’m glad to have taken part in this competition.\n\nI originally expected to bolster my knowledge and skills in various languages and fields of software development. What I have learnt has gone beyond my expectations.\n\nGoogle Code-In has provided me with the platform to meet students all over the world and have a stake in various wonderful organizations.\n\nThis has been my first, and unfortunately my last year participating in Google Code-In. I’m really grateful to the organization JBoss for their efforts and patience (this is their first year in GCI!), my fellow students who have been really friendly and Google for giving all of us this opportunity.\n",

Few years back, I attended a seminar in my school which was conducted by a Google Employee from the school’s Alumni.\nUpset from last GCI, I made a knot that Quality » Quantity. This is the reason that I stopped counting my tasks and started looking forward to What I am submitting.\n\nDifficulties\n\nThe only difficulty I faced is that It is my Class 12 which means my final Board class. So balancing was difficult but I am trying to give my 100% to both.\n\nI generally do Coding and Documentation tasks. The main reason is that I can contribute to community and help others too by documenting.\n\nThings Acheived\n\n\n  More Experience\n  Attention and help from the Mentors (A Lot!)\n  Helping others as I go on\n  Improvement in my Coding with the help of Mentors\n  Motivation and Appreciation from all.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI Hope that I can provide my best to this JBoss community and the Open Source World.\n",

It’s been about 10 days and I’ve completed around 10 tasks. I’d a pretty slow start but then I caught up my pace. The real difficulty with this competition is that it’s around the time of my examinations. It’s a quite tough task to do both GCI &amp; exams and sometimes the time “equilibrium” for both is not maintained. My biggest fear in this event is to abandon a task and feel gloomy about it. Right now I’m completing all the “User interface” tasks and some basic coding tasks as well. The overall spirit amongst us is high and I hope I get the chance to achieve something huge in my life !\n\nWhat have I gained ?\n\n\n  The GCI t-shirt (jk)\n  Experience about professionalism\n  The experience of meeting fellow participants around the globe\n  The mentorship given by our great mentors\n  The chance to see where I stand amongst others\n\n\nI hope my contributions to Open Source would help this community.\n",

Til now I’ve made some little progress on a handful small projects built for myself, yet contributing to the open source world and collaborating with other devs is something I never did before until I get to know GCI by a lucky chance, and that is full of fun and EXCITEMENT.\n\nIt has been a great time working with JBoss Community which is actually the most popular org in GCI currently XD. Competing with other passionate contestants while working with them at the same time is really challenging yet fascinating. Even though there’re some technologies I’m not good at or haven’t encountered before, contributing to the construction of those project with what I know and what I’m capable of gives me unprecedented satisfactions.\n\nWish I have a good time seeing billions of my tasks got approved XD.\n",

It has only been about 2 days since it started, but ever since then, every spare moment I have had the privilege of experiencing is spent browsing the GCI Home page for new tasks or hoping for approval on my current tasks.\n\nI find programming to be a fascinating subject, and want to pursue a career in this field. I am absolutely certain that Google Code In and JBoss, the organisation that the majority of my tasks belong to, will help me make this dream a reality.\n",

        "content": "My Experience at Google Code In 2017\n\nThe concept of competitive programming had been relatively new to me until I heard of Google Code In and Code Jam. I decided to have a go at 2017’s Code In, expecting a new and fun-filled experience. And I sure wasn’t disappointed.\n\nI was waiting for the opening of registrations on November 28, refreshing the page every five seconds to check if the contest had begun yet. And finally, three minutes past the scheduled time, I was able to register. The tasks page had an unending number of challenging tasks, and I was tempted to claim each and every one of them. Being a first time participant, I didn’t know that only one task could be claimed at a time. The task I chose first was a UI design one, as UI development and coding were among my favourite categories. Unfortunately, I couldn’t complete the task, and had to abandon it.\n\nLater, I continued checking out other tasks, and claimed a logo design task by JBoss Community. It got approved, and that was a major boost in my confidence. Since then, I have claimed many UI/coding tasks, and I have been enjoying completing all of them.\n\nWhat I gained at GCI 2017\n\n  I could acquire a very specific skill set required to complete tasks.\n  Meeting people around the world was a delight, as I could learn a lot of things from them.\n  The mentors were helpful, and were more like peers who would patiently talk to us and help solve our issues.\n\n\nIn short, GCI was a sweet and extravagant event for me, and it has been more of a learning experience than a competiton, and has helped me witness the true power of open source.\n\nI’m surely participating every year from now on!\n",

        "content": "Contributing to open source can be exciting as well as scary at the same time. If you are a newbie, then entering into the world of open source can be a really overwhelming experience for sure.\n\nThe term “open source” refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. Open source software is software developed by and for the user community. If you want to contribute to open source projects then GitHub is the next thing you need to be familiar with.\n\n\n\nFor contributing to open source, you don’t need to be a developer. A non-programmer can also do a variety of stuffs like documentation , designing and suggesting features.\n\nDocumentation plays a vital role in understanding of the project. Every project repository in GitHub comes with a README file stating how to use the project and how to set up the environment for running it.\n\nHow to contribute to open source?\n\n  Choose a project meeting your requirement and skill set.\n  Pick an issue to work upon or raise an issue if you find some bug in the project\n  After fixing the problem highlighted in the issue, open a pull request for it.\n  If your pull request need to be worked on further, then it’s  better to write WIP [work in progress]\n  Try following the guidelines while submitting a patch\n\n\nEasy! Isn’t it?\nAfter following these  little steps, you can congratulate yourself. You have now contributed to open source which felt terrifying in the beginning.\n\nThis is an amazing experience to get to know that a project you worked on is now being used by millions of users. Moreover, you get a chance to interact with other people of your domain. You can learn from them and improve to an extend you have not anticipated. So get , set and start contributing!!\n",
