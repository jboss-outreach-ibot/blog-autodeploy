<p>Hi, my name is Aniol, I am a 13-year-old student, and I am participating in the Google Code-In contest. I’m here to talk about my JBoss developer community experience that I have lived since Google Code-in started. JBoss was not one of my main goals to work on. But in the end, I chose it because of the variety of projects that there were and the different amount of tasks that there were.</p>

<h3 id="mentors--students">Mentors &amp; Students</h3>

<p>In when the mentors, moments are very nice and friendly. Now as for the community (the developers), I have not had too much contact with them but I have spoken with someone through the chat and they seem very kind.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h3>

<p>Participating in open source projects is very fun if you like to program, a good open source project is Google Code-in, a very fun open source project with prizes that you can easily earn if you are consistent and commit to help.</p>

<p>This in addition to helping to make known your skills will help you develop your creativity and make more people known.
You do not necessarily have to contribute programing, you can also do something by contributing ideas or modifying documents.</p>

<h3 id="jboss-community-and-open-source-projects">JBoss Community and Open Source Projects</h3>

<p>I didn’t have previous experience in a real open source project, and with JBoss Community I started with those, JBoss Community made me release that is the quality what matters not the quantity. I have made a great advance since I started, and that has taken me effort that I never thought I should give to program.</p>
