        "content": "I attended a RedHat (parent company of JBoss) webinar on virtualization. The main objective was to introduce various businesses and students to the Virtualization &amp; RedHat’s flagship Virtualization software. The webinar was hosted by Gunnar Hellekson &amp; Rex Backman. The webinar focused on how can virtualization be beneficial for companies and businesses.\n\nWhat is virtualization ?\n\nVirtualization is the process of creating a software-based (or virtual) representation of something rather than a physical one. Virtualization can apply to applications, servers, storage, and networks and is the one of the most effective ways to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. Virtualization will remain an integral part of the modern datacenter for the next several years. According to the Uptime Institute, up to 65% of workloads are still on-premise. While virtualized workloads may give way to the cloud and other emerging technologies, it still puts virtualization in focus as a technology that needs to be modernized.\n\nAdvantages of virtualization :-\n\n\n  Can be useful websites and web app builds &amp; tests\n  Can be easily transferred to cloud\n  Reduced infrastructure costs\n  Reduced electronic costs\n  Can improve performance\n  Easy migration from one Virtual machine to other\n  Improved security\n\n\nAfter discussing the above points briefly, the topic of discussion shifted from just virtualization to comparison of various virtualization applications. Various applications like VMware were compared with RedHat virtualization applications.\n\nQuestion that I asked :-\n\nQ. How can students be introduced to Virtualization ?\n\nA. Students can checkout oVirt, a RedHat opensource initiative targeting virtualization being introduced to the small businesses and students. Also RedHat opensource forums can help for the same.\n\nHow I use virtualization :-\n\n\n  I’ve a MacBook Pro and I use Oracle’s VirtualBox to run Kali Linux for learning basic penetration testing and ethical hacking.\n  Most commonly for Mobile application development, I use Android Studio (for Android) &amp; Xcode (for iOS) in-built emulators.\n\n",

        "content": "Google Code-In\nGoogle Code-in is a competitive event organised by Google which exposes young and budding developers to open source organisations, in a task based environment. In this way, they learn different ways to solve real life problems for open source organisations. This gives people much-needed experience that they will need to deal with situations they may face during their jobs or other later ventures. Famous open source organisations like Ubuntu, Wikimedia, and Apertium have come together to create tasks that will help the participants, and the open source organisations that are helping in this event.\n\nWhat I’ve learnt:\nThis is the primary time I’m collaborating in Google code in 2017, so way it’s been fruitful. I learned regarding Musicbrainz, a music data wiki, and  the Metabrainz foundation that maintains it. I actually have learned about the JBoss stretch organization, that has created some attention-grabbing comes sort of Facebook meme generator bot.  i do know a way to use AN IRC consumer, and it’s been terribly useful for human activity with totally different organizations, and receiving feedback regarding my work. One particular factor about Google Code-In is that there are mentors, who are going to be there to tell you if you’re doing something wrong. I actually have learned to gift my work properly, and use many tools within the method. Even within the method of penning this web log post, I actually have learned a way to use Jekyll to come up with web log posts and use markdown to format them.\n\nI have learned lots and understood however my skills ar applicable within the globe as a result of Google Code-In 2017. I’d wish to impart Google for giving Maine this chance to be told things by determination my very own issues, and other’s issues. I hope to extend the depth of my data, and improve my existing skill set by completing competitions and artistic contests like Google Code-In!\nThanks to collaborating in GCI, i used to be ready to polish my English and work level supported however I add giant corporations.I gained plenty information|of data|of information} and knowledge in technology. I got accustomed mistreatment disagreeable person, writing in English and checking out info, i.e. operating with documentation (sometimes language, generally an internet site like IBM Bluemix) and Stack Overflow. This contest was conjointly a chance to go away the cave and take a look at your ability\nThanks to JBoss Comunity, I will exchange experiences and skills with alternative GCI participants.\n\nI think that Google has done a good job making this competition, because of that several teens have an opportunity for a higher future.\nI’m definitely participating again! Thanks Jboss!\n",

I’m here to talk about my JBoss developer community experience that I have lived since Google Code-in started. JBoss was not one of my main goals to work on.

Now as for the community (the developers), I have not had too much contact with them but I have spoken with someone through the chat and they seem very kind.\n\nOpen Source Projects\n\nParticipating in open source projects is very fun if you like to program, a good open source project is Google Code-in, a very fun open source project with prizes that you can easily earn if you are consistent and commit to help.\n\nThis in addition to helping to make known your skills will help you develop your creativity and make more people known.\nYou do not necessarily have to contribute programing, you can also do something by contributing ideas or modifying documents.\n\nJBoss Community and Open Source Projects\n\nI didn’t have previous experience in a real open source project, and with JBoss Community I started with those, JBoss Community made me release that is the quality what matters not the quantity. I have made a great advance since I started, and that has taken me effort that I never thought I should give to program.\n\nTry hard and you will see what you get!\n",

With tasks in all branches of cyber-computing such as: Code, User Interface, Documentation/Training, Quality Assurance and Outreach/Research it is the ultimate competition.\n\nI found about GCI from a friend a year ago but I was too late to join in the fun. Now that I know how epic Google Code-in is, I really regret not being able to participate last year. Nevertheless, this year I have planned to complete as many GCI tasks as I can and not waste this opportunity.\n\nThe mentors are a great addition to the competition. Without them, I probably wouldn’t have any successful submissions. They really do help a lot and narrow the tasks down for us to understand it. No matter how wrong the first draft is or even the tenth draft. They keep on providing their services relentlessly. Their motivational chat-bits also keep us focus and regulate the ginormous enthusiasm.\n\nThe best thing about GCI is that it motivates us to surf the internet and learn to do things previously unheard-of. For example; Forking a Project in GitHub. It was something which I at first hearing about, thought of food but later I understood what it really was and how relevant it is. Never would this be possible had GCI not existed. The JBoss community can help me in this completion by introducing more tasks for me to accomplish so that I reach their leaderboard. It would be a great honour.\n\nThe first task is where the fear lies. After that it becomes your passion as it did for me. I remember my peers bragging about the number of tasks they completed last year and truthfully I was overwhelmed. How could a child of my age complete so many tasks in a world renowned completion I asked myself but now as I am a part of GCI just as much as they are.\n\nI used to constantly switch tabs between the problem, the procedure and help tabs that the google search engine helpfully provided me. Trying to piece together the solution and deciphering the answer to every problem really makes you feel alive. One after the other, slowly but surely each sub-problem I knocked out of the equation.\n\nWhen I completed my first task, I was hocked on to it like an anchor. I was the best experience by far. I had actually accomplished something and in doing so also benefited an actual organisation. That feeling is like no other. Soon I started to hunt for a second and a third. The third meant that I would get a google t-shirt from as a prize. I was psyched! I must admit I wasn’t the fastest to reach so far but I was defiantly determined and disciplined for the task. Day and night, I emptied the internet, disburdening it of its information and piecing together information to finish the task. ASAP!\n",

But I didn’t found the right platform to work. But one day I heard about Google Code-In from one of my friend. I gathered information about it from my friends and internet and later decided to participate in the contest.\n\nThe day when Google Code-In started-\n\nFirst day was quite exciting. As it was my first time, I decided to go with a simple task. The level of the task is quite variant so that everyone can participate and solve based on their skills. First day it took me a little time to search through the list of all organisation and decide one. Finally, I decided to go with Jboss community for their logo designing task.\n\nWhy I choose Jboss Community-\n\nFrom the very first day, Jboss community emerges to be the best organisation. I scroll through its tasks and found quite a few that were matching my domain and interest. Although, here competition is quite high but still I preferred to go with it. Also, mentors are very supportive and have helped me in guiding through various problems where I got stuck. Tasks are reviewed in few hours as comparison to the other organisations.\n\nWhat I hope to learn in this program-\n\nI hope that being a participant in this international level program will not only enhance my skills but will also boost up my confidence. As I have never been a part of such contests, so I have learnt many new things including how one should approach a mentor, discuss problems with them and how to work on GitHub. I got to learn many cool stuff like creating CSS animation, logos, working with Java script and many more. I hope I’ll make it to leaderboard this year and contribute my best to open-source.\n",

        "content": "Google Code-In is a program that is aimed at encouraging middle-school and high-school students to participate in Open Source. It usually runs for 7-8 weeks during Northern Hemisphere winters. The tasks given in Google Code-In are tasks that would take an experienced well-versed developer 2-3 hours to do so that a student would be able to do it within 5 days. You can apply via Google Melange portal. The applications for Google Code-In are open now. You can choose the organizations, apply for a task and the mentor of a task will choose from the pool of task applicants. If you are a within 13-17 years old and still in school, please apply for Code-In. I had a great experience being a participant there. People are extremely helpful and you will learn a lot.\n\nI registered myself in Google Code-In contest and soon started reading about the organization\nand out of so many organizations I like JBoss Community. I love designing things like logos, UI/UX, and a little bit of code. I started with the designing tasks and completed them soon and moved to the coding part where I build a basic iOS app. So far its been a wonderful experience in learning so many things like interacting with mentors and the hurdles you have to cross to complete the tasks,\nwhenever these hurdles come you experience something new and this experience is kind of a new learning.\n\nI got to know about Open-Source a year before when my brother started working on different open source on Github, I liked what he did and coding kind of attracted me, it looked cool but being an open source developer gives you a lot of experience about a lot of platforms at the same time, I liked the way my brother could pick any project of his own choice to work on. He liked python and knew it. So, he did most of his projects related to python.\n\nSo, I guess my open source journey started with this and when I heard about Google Code-In contest, it kind of boosted my energy and I thought I should enter this contest and so I did, and till now it’s going well.\n\nThe first time I gave up very easily, I always thought that the tasks were too difficult or I didn’t understand coding and I was too shy to ask for help on IRC while other students asked about more complex stuff, I thought people will laugh at me.\n\nThe second time, I began doing the task and with the grand prize in my mind, I got rid of my shyness, so I began and tried to always be working on a task It was frustrating sometimes but I kept going.\n\nI was doing great, Now I target an average of at least one task per day, and I am going with it. Tasks are a little bit difficult but I don’t start with them before I learn the language or design or whatever the task is about, I go through it first and then start working on it.\n\nTill now my Google Code-In experience has been going good and I look for learning more things.\n\nGoogle Code-In has been a change in my life as I am looking for tasks and eventually new things to learn and so far I am learning and experiencing new things.\n\nThank You, Google. :)\n",

        "content": "My Experience at Google Code In 2017\n\nThis is my second and I suppose the last year that I will be able to do Google Code In (I’ll be too old next year :( ). A lot has changed since the first time I participated in Google Code In, which was in 2016. During the 2016 competition I didn’t have much experience with Git or Github so I was struggling to complete many tasks. I ended up completing three tasks.\n\nSince then I have used Git and Github a lot more and feel much more comfortable using them. This year I changed my strategy to work harder, put in more effort and figure things out as I go. The key is to stick on one task and only one task until you complete it. This time around I am finding Google Code In much more engaging and interesting thanks in part to the great tasks by JBoss community but also because I am motivated and compelled to complete as many tasks I can whilst maintaining a high quality for each task due to this being my last opportunity to participate. I find myself working on GCI during any free moment in my day. The satisfaction of having a task accepted is immense, and every time a task is accepted I feel like I am one step closer to my goal.\n\nI like Google Code In because I see it as an extended hackathon. I’ve been to hackathons in the past and they have all compelled and somewhat forced me to learn something new in order to build a prototype in time. In the same way GCI motivates me to learn new things in order to complete tasks and therefore improve my skills to take on more challenging tasks. I feel that the JBoss community tasks are perfect for me as they challenge me in the right way. Thats why all the tasks I have completed and intend to complete are from JBoss Community.\n\nWhat I have learned so far at GCI 2017\n\n  Creating pull requests and issues\n  Working with various new technologies\n  Getting involved with the community i.e. helping others and receiving help.\n  How to setup a local server\n  What MongoDB is and how it is installed on Ubuntu\n  The basics of using Xcode\n\n\nI want to continue to learn new things through completing GCI tasks so that I can develop my skills further!\n",

I decided to have a go at 2017’s Code In, expecting a new and fun-filled experience. And I sure wasn’t disappointed.\n\nI was waiting for the opening of registrations on November 28, refreshing the page every five seconds to check if the contest had begun yet. And finally, three minutes past the scheduled time, I was able to register. The tasks page had an unending number of challenging tasks, and I was tempted to claim each and every one of them. Being a first time participant, I didn’t know that only one task could be claimed at a time. The task I chose first was a UI design one, as UI development and coding were among my favourite categories. Unfortunately, I couldn’t complete the task, and had to abandon it.\n\nLater, I continued checking out other tasks, and claimed a logo design task by JBoss Community. It got approved, and that was a major boost in my confidence. Since then, I have claimed many UI/coding tasks, and I have been enjoying completing all of them.\n\nWhat I gained at GCI 2017\n\n  I could acquire a very specific skill set required to complete tasks.\n  Meeting people around the world was a delight, as I could learn a lot of things from them.\n  The mentors were helpful, and were more like peers who would patiently talk to us and help solve our issues.\n\n\nIn short, GCI was a sweet and extravagant event for me, and it has been more of a learning experience than a competiton, and has helped me witness the true power of open source.\n\nI’m surely participating every year from now on!\n",

        "content": "{What is Google Code-In}\n\nGoogle Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development.\nOpen source organizations (chosen by Google) provide students with a list of tasks for which pupils work for 7 weeks.All organizations have the mentors who are assisting in the task.\n\n{Types of tasks}\n\nTasks are categorized as: Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance and User Interface. Students can claim and work on the task that interests them. They are provided anything between 3 to 7 days for its completion. Once the student feels their work is ready, they submit their work for review through the contest website. Mentors from the organization evaluate the work, provide feedback, and if it’s complete, approve it! Otherwise, specific important feedback is provided, and the student updates the work. Once a task is accepted, the student can claim another!\n\n{Prizes}\nThere is no such thing as a Google contest without Prizes, Google Code-In is not exception too. \nYou get an assured digital certificate, if you complete 1 task you can even earn a google tshirt if you complete 3 tasks. :D \nAt the end of the contest, five finalists are chosen to get hoodies and two of them are chosen to be the grand prize winners and earn themselves a trip to Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California!\nThe more tasks you do, with creativity and quality, the better chance you have to win the mega prize\n\n{Why you should take part in it?}\nGoogle code in aims to inculcate values of teamwork in the students. You even get a chance to, make friends from different countries around the world and most importantly get great experience. Prizes are definitely Google’s way to thank you for your hardwork. :D\n\n{ My Google Code-In Experience }\nThree weeks have passed since the start of Google’s event. as for the organization I chose the Jboss  Community by Redhat, because I was  familiar with the technologies and programming languages that were required to be a part of it. As of now, most of my  tasks are related to Android. Daily group work with foreigners has given me great experience in communication, writing clean code &amp; version control.The mentors and even the participating students are very helpful, I have learned a lot from them.\nDuring this time, we have created an Android Library, several applications and sites.  Two weeks after the start of the event, when I saw my organization’s page, I found a list of leaders where my name was written, this motivated me to do more and more stuff and cause my parents to be proud of me. :) I want to win and I will do everything for it but the competition is huge and even if I don’t win, I’ll be happy in being a part of the leader list. I. made a great decision by joining Google Code-In and i advise you to participate in Google Code-In and try your fate between 6500 pupils. ;)\n\nSaba Khukhunashvili\n\n",

        "content": "Contributing to open source can be exciting as well as scary at the same time. If you are a newbie, then entering into the world of open source can be a really overwhelming experience for sure.\n\nThe term “open source” refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. Open source software is software developed by and for the user community. If you want to contribute to open source projects then GitHub is the next thing you need to be familiar with.\n\n\n\nFor contributing to open source, you don’t need to be a developer. A non-programmer can also do a variety of stuffs like documentation , designing and suggesting features.\n\nDocumentation plays a vital role in understanding of the project. Every project repository in GitHub comes with a README file stating how to use the project and how to set up the environment for running it.\n\nHow to contribute to open source?\n\n  Choose a project meeting your requirement and skill set.\n  Pick an issue to work upon or raise an issue if you find some bug in the project\n  After fixing the problem highlighted in the issue, open a pull request for it.\n  If your pull request need to be worked on further, then it’s  better to write WIP [work in progress]\n  Try following the guidelines while submitting a patch\n\n\nEasy! Isn’t it?\nAfter following these  little steps, you can congratulate yourself. You have now contributed to open source which felt terrifying in the beginning.\n\nThis is an amazing experience to get to know that a project you worked on is now being used by millions of users. Moreover, you get a chance to interact with other people of your domain. You can learn from them and improve to an extend you have not anticipated. So get , set and start contributing!!\n",
