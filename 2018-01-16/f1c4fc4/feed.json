        "content": "Introduction\n\nHello everyone, I’m Zixin, an enthusiastic 17 year old from Singapore at Google Code-In! When I first encountered coding and interacted with Python, I was explicably drawn to its ability to not only solve problems, but more importantly link ideas from the creator to the computer and actually create something unique. \nIt was magic. \nIt intrigued me more than all my other subjects and I have since embarked on various projects, hackathons, and involved myself in conferences and helping the community. Thus I am participating in GCI 2017-18 to do all of the above and expand my interests and expertise in programming and open source projects.\n\nExperience\n\nIt was a very interesting and humbling experience to be able to contribute to such large scale open source projects and be guided by mentors along the way. At first glances the task seemed daunting but I started with easier ones like building and running a local node server hosted by JBoss - which was surprisingly well documented for a task with alright difficulty!\n\nThe mentors at JBoss are friendly and quick to respond and the experience of GCI was a great one. :) I would definitely recommend my juniors to participate and learn skills like forking a repository, hosting a local node server, and submitting your own bug fixes to a software open source code! :)\n",

        "title": "Google Code-In: The Coding Extravganza",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nSo first, before sharing my experience, let me introduce you to Google-Code In. So, Google Code-In is an annual contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, over 4500 students from 99 countries have completed work in the contest and this number is increasing every year.\n\nThe quality of tasks given to the students during the entire event is quite appropriate. The level of tasks keep increasing gradually. There are tasks for everybody, along with the coding tasks, there are documentation, outreach, user interface tasks as well.\n\nMy Experience\n\nThis was my first year participating in Code-In, during the entire event, I decided to work for the JBoss Community and I have totally loved the experience. This event has introduced to me proper Open Source Software development, I am amazed by seeing so many people come up and contribute to different projects.\n\nThe tasks offered to us by the JBoss Community were more focused on giving us the learning curve and introduce us to new technologies, I found them to be very interesting.\n\nSo now, let me walk you through how my one and a half month went:\n\nIt’s 10th of December, it’s the dreaded last happy day before the start of my Term 2 (semester end) exams. I wake up, get freshened and open my laptop. Now this may seem confusing to my classmates who would think that I am passing my time just one day before the start of my exams. But little do they know that I am in an environment which would teach me lots and lots of new things which would help me in the future.\n\nFast forward to 6 days, the next day I have my math exam and I am still on my laptop, I hear my mother shouting “kal maths exam hai, laptop band karo aur padhne baith jao” (“you have your math exam tomorrow, shut down your laptop and go study”) at that point of time, my mind thinks to obey what my mother just said, but my heart, disagreeing to this thought, being so addicted to this beautiful environment, refuses to leave it.\nWorking in this environment became a habit for me, I remember one incident, during my Computer Sciences exam, I finished it before the time limit and had around 20mins to spare. I took an extra sheet and utilised my time by making mockup icon for the compressor head android app (which was one of the tasks)\n\nThis is what a magnificent platform like Google Code In does to you. It makes you feel that excitement, makes you crave for that notification which says “Your Task got approved by your mentor”. It makes you beat the competition and come on top. I can’t even describe that feeling which I got when I saw my name on the leaderboard, it was just amazing.\n\nI tried to balance the number of tasks I did with their categories. Initially as I was not properly accustomed to the technologies required but with time, tried to grasp them and how they worked. Inspired by this, I made an unofficial moto for Google Code in which wash “Learn what you fear”\n\nDuring the course of this event, I worked multiple JBoss projects like Lead Management Android app which is an app for the businesses to manage their potential leads and increase their productivity. The certifier project which would allow any organisation head to generate certificates of any event, the compressor head android app which lets user compress images before downloading them. I also helped build our official website for GCI 2017. I enjoyed a lot in contributing to these.\n\nOne of the main objectives of this event is to make you connect with the online open source community and I feel that this is easily the best part about it. There were participants from all around the globe, I made a lot of friends, throughout the event, we helped each other, sometimes talked about how each of our countries differed from each other from giving school holidays :P to even the cultures. All of the mentors at my  Even the mentors were very friendly to us. They helped us however small the problem was. Sometimes, they also asked us about our school lives and how we can improve ourselves to become better in the future. So, socialising with others was definitely the best value which I learnt.\n\nThe second thing I learnt was to never give up on trying until you get what you want. Earlier, I found some tasks to be difficult and feared them, but later I learned how not to fear them and then I started to intentionally take up those tasks and took time to learn about them. This principle, I also started applying in my day to day life and it helped me a lot\n\nI am writing this with just 2 days to go before this event ends and it feels like it just started yesterday. I am already feeling nostalgic and sad that this amazing experience is going to end. During the course of this event, open source has influenced me a lot, I will definitely continue to make more and more contributions to The JBoss Community and rest of the open source world.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the JBoss Community. Everything about it, the mentors, the participating students is just amazing, there is definitely a special bond which exists between us. :)\n\nSo, before ending this blog, I would like to thank all the mentors who gave their best in helping us. Also, a big thanks to Google for providing such an amazing platform to us youngsters, A huge round of applause for everyone including the students for making this event a suceess!\n\nWrapping it up,  I would say that this one and a half month were the best I could have utilised in 2017 and in the start of 2018. :)\n\nThank You\n\n~ Divyansh Kulshreshtha\n",

        "title": "Red Hat Dev Event: IT modernization through automation",
        "content": "Introduction\nThe webinar was on held on January 12th 2018 and was on the topic Automation for network infrastructures, it was hosted by Gerald Dykeman who works as a Domain Architect at Ansible. The webinar was mainly focused on the principle of Hero As Code and why we need a proper network automation system and how Ansible helps us in achieving that.\n\nWhat is Hero As Code?\nSo, let’s imagine a person, say Bob. Bob is the one who designs, builds, fixes and maintains the network all on his own. So Bob is the Hero for us. But, Heroes are in high demand, Bob knows a lot and can work on any project, but the problem with this is Bob is called everywhere! He is not able to manage so many clients together. So here comes the principle of Hero As Code, in this theoretically, Bob and the entire infrastructure is converted into code. All of his basic (and some complex) functions are written into the codebase. This is somewhat what serves as the base of network automation.\n\nThe Primitive Network Structures\nWe are in 2018, and people still configure VLANs on their respective networks manually, people are still hesitant to go towards the route of automation because they are mostly worried that the process might go down at any point of time and then there won’t be any human power to handle those errors.\nIn primitive network structures, the team or individual maintaining it is usually the main component. This methodology is not exactly fool proof as there can be a number of human error and sometimes even a small mistake can cause the entire network to go down.\n\nWhy automation?\nSo this takes us to the very important question, Why automation of networks? How is it any beneficial from what we are using now?\nSo, few of the advantages of network automation are: \nBackups and restore can be easily automated.\nEnsures proper working of networks without or hardly any use of manpower. \nThe process of  Plan → Develop → Test → Deploy → Operate can be executed a lot faster.\n\nWhat is Ansible\nSo, Ansible is basically a software company owned by Red Hat Inc.  that automates provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. Ansible makes it easy to scale automation, manage complex deployments and thus it increases the overall productivity of the project.\n\nWhy Ansible?\nThe next question that may arise in your mind is why Ansible? So, Ansible is simple, no special coding skills are required to work with it, it’s very powerful, and is very secure. Currently it supports 33 networking platforms and over 460+ networking modules (modules from Cisco, Juniper. Dell and many more!)\nAnsible works via small individual modules and these can be used according to the requirements for example the cisco module can be used only for some parts of the network and the rest can be configured automatically, Most of the configuration is done in the yaml file. The Ansible tower supports different APIs . The tower takes in the API calls and configures the server accordingly. \nIt also has integrations with popular services like Splunk, VMware, Atlassian, Gitlab and almost all of Red Hat products.\n\nQuestions Raised\n\nQ.1 Why is automation the prefered way in the future?\n\nAns. Network automation should be preferred because it has several benefits for the user, its helps reduce the workload as, you are still doing the same stuff that you were doing earlier, but now you can repeat that and iterate on that. This makes the whole process efficient.\n\nQ.2 How is the principle of Hero as code and Ansible going to affect the network engineers?\n\nAns, The engineers have problems in scaling, for every fault that occurs, it is not possible for the administrator to go and fix them. Basically, if there is something that you repeat, should be automated and Ansible does just that, it kicks away the manual tasks and allows you to do things that matter to your business.\n\nMy Experience\nThis was my first professional developer webinar.I was confused about how this event would turn out for me as although I was familiar with network architectures, automation and related terminologies, I did not have a deep knowledge of any of them but the webinar was very well organised and the speaker explained each and every topic beautifully. It introduced me to network automation and how it will be beneficial for everyone in the future. I got to know about Ansible and how it would help us reach almost complete automation of our network infrastructures.\n",

Google Code-in liaises with several top-notch technology companies, providing me a platform to discover and learn more about these very companies and their communities. One such example is the JBoss Community.\n\nJBoss Community is a community of open source projects, hosting projects of various programming languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP, Node, etc. As I have only started learning Python, I hope to branch out to various programming languages as time goes by. JBoss Community could serve as a great platform for my self-tutorial purposes.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend everyone- whether you have a tech background or not, to give GCI a go, then pick up skills and knowledge of different communities along the way! 😊\n",

The link was here.\n\nWho Was It From\nThis webinar was given by Syed Rasheed, the Solution Marketing Manager of Red Hat.\n\nWhat Is RHOAR\nDuring the presentation, Rasheed introduced the Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes (RHOAR), which is a collection of cloud-native runtimes for developing Java or JavaScript applications on OpenShift.\n\nIt provides portability across multiple cloud infrastructures, allowing the developer to use microservices, containers, and DevOps automation.\n\nWhat Did I Learn\nTraditionally, the Monolith Java EE Lifecycle is three months. That basically means that it usually takes up to three months for a simple change in Java or JavaScript Apps to be deployed on a cloud platform.\n\nThat is like, if you changed a single line of your App, and you want all the users to get an update, that takes 3 months.\n\nHowever, with RHOAR, companies can build and deploy all the Java or JavaScript Apps on OpenShift with the simpler development process, flexible strategic as well as the automation from development to deployment that provide speed with standardization.\n\nMoreover, RHOAR allows the developers to use microservices to speed up the software release cycles, which are compatible with numerous Java runtimes including JBoss EAP, Vert.X, WildFly Swarm, Node.js, Tomcat and so on.\n\nTherefore, with the help of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, the App release cycle can be optimized from 3  months down to 16 minutes. As Rasheed concludes, “The cloud software deployment is approaching a zero-day event.”\n\nOverall,\nThe whole concept of Cloud Native Development and Application Runtimes was actually quite strange to me as I had never encountered such terminology before.\n\nThough attending this webinar, I’m able to gain a basic understanding of what is going on in the process of deploying a Java or JavaScript App, how it used to be sophisticated and what can Red Hat do with RHOAR to help greatly improve that.\n\nIn general, I am glad and thankful for being able to attend such an event for the first time of my life, which indeed expanded my knowledge.\n",

        "content": "I attended a RedHat (parent company of JBoss) webinar on virtualization. The main objective was to introduce various businesses and students to the Virtualization &amp; RedHat’s flagship Virtualization software. The webinar was hosted by Gunnar Hellekson &amp; Rex Backman. The webinar focused on how can virtualization be beneficial for companies and businesses.\n\nWhat is virtualization ?\n\nVirtualization is the process of creating a software-based (or virtual) representation of something rather than a physical one. Virtualization can apply to applications, servers, storage, and networks and is the one of the most effective ways to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. Virtualization will remain an integral part of the modern datacenter for the next several years. According to the Uptime Institute, up to 65% of workloads are still on-premise. While virtualized workloads may give way to the cloud and other emerging technologies, it still puts virtualization in focus as a technology that needs to be modernized.\n\nAdvantages of virtualization :-\n\n\n  Can be useful websites and web app builds &amp; tests\n  Can be easily transferred to cloud\n  Reduced infrastructure costs\n  Reduced electronic costs\n  Can improve performance\n  Easy migration from one Virtual machine to other\n  Improved security\n\n\nAfter discussing the above points briefly, the topic of discussion shifted from just virtualization to comparison of various virtualization applications. Various applications like VMware were compared with RedHat virtualization applications.\n\nQuestion that I asked :-\n\nQ. How can students be introduced to Virtualization ?\n\nA. Students can checkout oVirt, a RedHat opensource initiative targeting virtualization being introduced to the small businesses and students. Also RedHat opensource forums can help for the same.\n\nHow I use virtualization :-\n\n\n  I’ve a MacBook Pro and I use Oracle’s VirtualBox to run Kali Linux for learning basic penetration testing and ethical hacking.\n  Most commonly for Mobile application development, I use Android Studio (for Android) &amp; Xcode (for iOS) in-built emulators.\n\n",

        "content": "I anxiously waited for the event to start. It had been quite some time of constant refreshing of the JBoss event page where one could only login and join the discussion 15 minutes before the event started. I was full of curiosity. It was going to my first developer event.\n\nSoon, a notice popped up -  the Event is about to begin, please wait a few minutes. That really got my heart racing! I realize that it is a trivial thing to be excited about, but I just could not stop myself!\n\nSoon enough, the webinar, Virtualization as a path to an optimized, modern datacenter started. The presenters were full of enthusiasm and I could tell that they knew everything there was to know within the subject. I was a little fazed in the beginning of the webinar, since this was actually the second conference in a series of 3. It did not help that the volume was a little low and microphone not so clear in the beginning. However, I asked a few questions, and the presenters were extremely helpful in their answers.\n\nI attended the webinar with very little knowledge of what Virtualization actually meant. I learnt that it optimized digital transmission, was at the peak of innovation in this modern era, and increased the competitive capability of any company. It essentially modernizes infrastructure and applications, and is a key enabler in helping us on our digital transmission journey. As the presenter explained to me in relatively simple words, virtualization means to create a virtual version of a device or resource, like a server or a network where the framework divides the resource into one or more execution environments.\n\nMost people actually think virtualization is being adopted everywhere and this period has now rolled over, but in reality, this is not the case at all. RedHat conducted surveys where they found out that virtualization is actually on the rise! In fact, it is expected to rise by over 20% in deployment over the next 2 years.\n\nRedHat is at the forefront of virtualization, and the fact that the Director of Project Management actually spoke for the majority of the time gave me a very good impression of the company.\n\nI learnt a lot about virtualization today, which reduces infrastructure costs and improves performance too, among other benefits. I was also introduced to a plethora of new architectures, and to the steps to actually implement RedHat’s program.\n\nMy first developer conference was as awesome and informative as I expected it to be. It was a great experience, and I look forward to attending another event soon!\n",

I love everything related to them let it be gaming, editing stuffs or coding.\nThis year I decided to participate in the GCI.\nI chose JBoss Community on reading that it is related to Java.\nI got to learn about many open-source softwares. They are great to work with. You can use them and also modify and upgrade those softwares which is a great thing.\nI learnt how to develop apps, integrate authentication methods, designing webpages and various other stuffs.\nAt present I know Java, Javascript, C++, C#, Swift, HTML, CSS and I would love to learn more and master in these programming languages too.\nBefore GCI, I had very less knowledge about opensource. I wasn’t aware of the tremendous benefits it gives. But now I love using opensource softwares.\n\n##Mentors\nThe mentors are really good and cooperative.\nThey check all our works and also advice us on improving our programming skills and also to rectify to mistakes.\nThey are really friendly and never step back in clearing doubts or helping in any other ways.\n\n#What I have gained till now from GCI\n\n\n  A t-shirt(After completion of 3 tasks)\n  A whole lot of knowledge in the field of web page designing and app development\n  Also got to know about many open source softwares.\n\n\n##End\nIn the end I would conclude this by saying that GCI gave me a nice opportunity to improve my coding skills as well as learn many new things. It also gave me new friends and supporting mentors who ere always there to guide us. Whether I get prize or not, I ll forever remember such valuable experience because learning is more important than winning.\n\nThank You\n",

        "content": "MY GOOGLE CODE-IN EXPERIENCE\n\nGoogle code-in is a world-wide competition held by the folks at Google annually which provides a platform for us to explore new and interesting organisations and also help them! With tasks in all branches of cyber-computing such as: Code, User Interface, Documentation/Training, Quality Assurance and Outreach/Research it is the ultimate competition.\n\nI found about GCI from a friend a year ago but I was too late to join in the fun. Now that I know how epic Google Code-in is, I really regret not being able to participate last year. Nevertheless, this year I have planned to complete as many GCI tasks as I can and not waste this opportunity.\n\nThe mentors are a great addition to the competition. Without them, I probably wouldn’t have any successful submissions. They really do help a lot and narrow the tasks down for us to understand it. No matter how wrong the first draft is or even the tenth draft. They keep on providing their services relentlessly. Their motivational chat-bits also keep us focus and regulate the ginormous enthusiasm.\n\nThe best thing about GCI is that it motivates us to surf the internet and learn to do things previously unheard-of. For example; Forking a Project in GitHub. It was something which I at first hearing about, thought of food but later I understood what it really was and how relevant it is. Never would this be possible had GCI not existed. The JBoss community can help me in this completion by introducing more tasks for me to accomplish so that I reach their leaderboard. It would be a great honour.\n\nThe first task is where the fear lies. After that it becomes your passion as it did for me. I remember my peers bragging about the number of tasks they completed last year and truthfully I was overwhelmed. How could a child of my age complete so many tasks in a world renowned completion I asked myself but now as I am a part of GCI just as much as they are.\n\nI used to constantly switch tabs between the problem, the procedure and help tabs that the google search engine helpfully provided me. Trying to piece together the solution and deciphering the answer to every problem really makes you feel alive. One after the other, slowly but surely each sub-problem I knocked out of the equation.\n\nWhen I completed my first task, I was hocked on to it like an anchor. I was the best experience by far. I had actually accomplished something and in doing so also benefited an actual organisation. That feeling is like no other. Soon I started to hunt for a second and a third. The third meant that I would get a google t-shirt from as a prize. I was psyched! I must admit I wasn’t the fastest to reach so far but I was defiantly determined and disciplined for the task. Day and night, I emptied the internet, disburdening it of its information and piecing together information to finish the task. ASAP!\n",

But I didn’t found the right platform to work. But one day I heard about Google Code-In from one of my friend. I gathered information about it from my friends and internet and later decided to participate in the contest.\n\nThe day when Google Code-In started-\n\nFirst day was quite exciting. As it was my first time, I decided to go with a simple task. The level of the task is quite variant so that everyone can participate and solve based on their skills. First day it took me a little time to search through the list of all organisation and decide one. Finally, I decided to go with Jboss community for their logo designing task.\n\nWhy I choose Jboss Community-\n\nFrom the very first day, Jboss community emerges to be the best organisation. I scroll through its tasks and found quite a few that were matching my domain and interest. Although, here competition is quite high but still I preferred to go with it. Also, mentors are very supportive and have helped me in guiding through various problems where I got stuck. Tasks are reviewed in few hours as comparison to the other organisations.\n\nWhat I hope to learn in this program-\n\nI hope that being a participant in this international level program will not only enhance my skills but will also boost up my confidence. As I have never been a part of such contests, so I have learnt many new things including how one should approach a mentor, discuss problems with them and how to work on GitHub. I got to learn many cool stuff like creating CSS animation, logos, working with Java script and many more. I hope I’ll make it to leaderboard this year and contribute my best to open-source.\n",

        "content": "Google Code-In is a program that is aimed at encouraging middle-school and high-school students to participate in Open Source. It usually runs for 7-8 weeks during Northern Hemisphere winters. The tasks given in Google Code-In are tasks that would take an experienced well-versed developer 2-3 hours to do so that a student would be able to do it within 5 days. You can apply via Google Melange portal. The applications for Google Code-In are open now. You can choose the organizations, apply for a task and the mentor of a task will choose from the pool of task applicants. If you are a within 13-17 years old and still in school, please apply for Code-In. I had a great experience being a participant there. People are extremely helpful and you will learn a lot.\n\nI registered myself in Google Code-In contest and soon started reading about the organization\nand out of so many organizations I like JBoss Community. I love designing things like logos, UI/UX, and a little bit of code. I started with the designing tasks and completed them soon and moved to the coding part where I build a basic iOS app. So far its been a wonderful experience in learning so many things like interacting with mentors and the hurdles you have to cross to complete the tasks,\nwhenever these hurdles come you experience something new and this experience is kind of a new learning.\n\nI got to know about Open-Source a year before when my brother started working on different open source on Github, I liked what he did and coding kind of attracted me, it looked cool but being an open source developer gives you a lot of experience about a lot of platforms at the same time, I liked the way my brother could pick any project of his own choice to work on. He liked python and knew it. So, he did most of his projects related to python.\n\nSo, I guess my open source journey started with this and when I heard about Google Code-In contest, it kind of boosted my energy and I thought I should enter this contest and so I did, and till now it’s going well.\n\nThe first time I gave up very easily, I always thought that the tasks were too difficult or I didn’t understand coding and I was too shy to ask for help on IRC while other students asked about more complex stuff, I thought people will laugh at me.\n\nThe second time, I began doing the task and with the grand prize in my mind, I got rid of my shyness, so I began and tried to always be working on a task It was frustrating sometimes but I kept going.\n\nI was doing great, Now I target an average of at least one task per day, and I am going with it. Tasks are a little bit difficult but I don’t start with them before I learn the language or design or whatever the task is about, I go through it first and then start working on it.\n\nTill now my Google Code-In experience has been going good and I look for learning more things.\n\nGoogle Code-In has been a change in my life as I am looking for tasks and eventually new things to learn and so far I am learning and experiencing new things.\n\nThank You, Google. :)\n",

        "content": "My Experience at Google Code In 2017\n\nThis is my second and I suppose the last year that I will be able to do Google Code In (I’ll be too old next year :( ). A lot has changed since the first time I participated in Google Code In, which was in 2016. During the 2016 competition I didn’t have much experience with Git or Github so I was struggling to complete many tasks. I ended up completing three tasks.\n\nSince then I have used Git and Github a lot more and feel much more comfortable using them. This year I changed my strategy to work harder, put in more effort and figure things out as I go. The key is to stick on one task and only one task until you complete it. This time around I am finding Google Code In much more engaging and interesting thanks in part to the great tasks by JBoss community but also because I am motivated and compelled to complete as many tasks I can whilst maintaining a high quality for each task due to this being my last opportunity to participate. I find myself working on GCI during any free moment in my day. The satisfaction of having a task accepted is immense, and every time a task is accepted I feel like I am one step closer to my goal.\n\nI like Google Code In because I see it as an extended hackathon. I’ve been to hackathons in the past and they have all compelled and somewhat forced me to learn something new in order to build a prototype in time. In the same way GCI motivates me to learn new things in order to complete tasks and therefore improve my skills to take on more challenging tasks. I feel that the JBoss community tasks are perfect for me as they challenge me in the right way. Thats why all the tasks I have completed and intend to complete are from JBoss Community.\n\nWhat I have learned so far at GCI 2017\n\n  Creating pull requests and issues\n  Working with various new technologies\n  Getting involved with the community i.e. helping others and receiving help.\n  How to setup a local server\n  What MongoDB is and how it is installed on Ubuntu\n  The basics of using Xcode\n\n\nI want to continue to learn new things through completing GCI tasks so that I can develop my skills further!\n",

I decided to have a go at 2017’s Code In, expecting a new and fun-filled experience. And I sure wasn’t disappointed.\n\nI was waiting for the opening of registrations on November 28, refreshing the page every five seconds to check if the contest had begun yet. And finally, three minutes past the scheduled time, I was able to register. The tasks page had an unending number of challenging tasks, and I was tempted to claim each and every one of them. Being a first time participant, I didn’t know that only one task could be claimed at a time. The task I chose first was a UI design one, as UI development and coding were among my favourite categories. Unfortunately, I couldn’t complete the task, and had to abandon it.\n\nLater, I continued checking out other tasks, and claimed a logo design task by JBoss Community. It got approved, and that was a major boost in my confidence. Since then, I have claimed many UI/coding tasks, and I have been enjoying completing all of them.\n\nWhat I gained at GCI 2017\n\n  I could acquire a very specific skill set required to complete tasks.\n  Meeting people around the world was a delight, as I could learn a lot of things from them.\n  The mentors were helpful, and were more like peers who would patiently talk to us and help solve our issues.\n\n\nIn short, GCI was a sweet and extravagant event for me, and it has been more of a learning experience than a competiton, and has helped me witness the true power of open source.\n\nI’m surely participating every year from now on!\n",

Students can claim and work on the task that interests them. They are provided anything between 3 to 7 days for its completion. Once the student feels their work is ready, they submit their work for review through the contest website. Mentors from the organization evaluate the work, provide feedback, and if it’s complete, approve it! Otherwise, specific important feedback is provided, and the student updates the work. Once a task is accepted, the student can claim another!\n\n{Prizes}\nThere is no such thing as a Google contest without Prizes, Google Code-In is not exception too. \nYou get an assured digital certificate, if you complete 1 task you can even earn a google tshirt if you complete 3 tasks. :D \nAt the end of the contest, five finalists are chosen to get hoodies and two of them are chosen to be the grand prize winners and earn themselves a trip to Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California!\nThe more tasks you do, with creativity and quality, the better chance you have to win the mega prize\n\n{Why you should take part in it?}\nGoogle code in aims to inculcate values of teamwork in the students. You even get a chance to, make friends from different countries around the world and most importantly get great experience. Prizes are definitely Google’s way to thank you for your hardwork. :D\n\n{ My Google Code-In Experience }\nThree weeks have passed since the start of Google’s event. as for the organization I chose the Jboss  Community by Redhat, because I was  familiar with the technologies and programming languages that were required to be a part of it. As of now, most of my  tasks are related to Android. Daily group work with foreigners has given me great experience in communication, writing clean code &amp; version control.The mentors and even the participating students are very helpful, I have learned a lot from them.\nDuring this time, we have created an Android Library, several applications and sites.  Two weeks after the start of the event, when I saw my organization’s page, I found a list of leaders where my name was written, this motivated me to do more and more stuff and cause my parents to be proud of me. :) I want to win and I will do everything for it but the competition is huge and even if I don’t win, I’ll be happy in being a part of the leader list.

If you are a newbie, then entering into the world of open source can be a really overwhelming experience for sure.\n\nThe term “open source” refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. Open source software is software developed by and for the user community. If you want to contribute to open source projects then GitHub is the next thing you need to be familiar with.\n\n\n\nFor contributing to open source, you don’t need to be a developer. A non-programmer can also do a variety of stuffs like documentation , designing and suggesting features.\n\nDocumentation plays a vital role in understanding of the project. Every project repository in GitHub comes with a README file stating how to use the project and how to set up the environment for running it.\n\nHow to contribute to open source?\n\n  Choose a project meeting your requirement and skill set.\n  Pick an issue to work upon or raise an issue if you find some bug in the project\n  After fixing the problem highlighted in the issue, open a pull request for it.\n  If your pull request need to be worked on further, then it’s  better to write WIP [work in progress]\n  Try following the guidelines while submitting a patch\n\n\nEasy! Isn’t it?\nAfter following these  little steps, you can congratulate yourself. You have now contributed to open source which felt terrifying in the beginning.\n\nThis is an amazing experience to get to know that a project you worked on is now being used by millions of users. Moreover, you get a chance to interact with other people of your domain. You can learn from them and improve to an extend you have not anticipated. So get , set and start contributing!!\n",

But when I came to JBOSS Community I was encouraged by the mentors and my friends in the Gitter Channel. I think JBOSS’s website creation is the best in the world… Their working on a great project like the compressor head project. “JBOSS is the Big BOSS “ To know more about JBoss just go to this link: https://gci.jboss-outreach.org/ . To join the JBOSS channel and chat with the mentors and contributors go to this link: https://gitter.im/jboss-outreach/gci.\n\nGoogle Code-In (2017-2018) :\n\nThis contest will attract many students to participate in it as they award a shirt for completing just three tasks. Most of them participate in it to get a t-shirt. I learnt a lot from this contest. I learnt git in one day. That was a big achievement for me. My mentors were very kind to me. @Murad was the mentor who approved me for all the tasks. Every mentor in JBoss Community was working all nights and days. This is a good contest as every teen get to learn about coding, designing and many other things. I learnt to design and coding. If I don’t win also I will not cry because I got a great community to contribute and to work with them. I am a 14-year-old app developer. I guess I learnt many things to improve my app. Google is keeping the world engaged in their contests throughout the year. This will be a great opportunity for many teens. This will recognize the great and superb coders in the world and give them awards which will encourage them. The feeling you get when you win a t-shirt from Google can’t be compared to anything in the world. Thanks for the memories and Thank you Google for the wonderful experience.I could learn many things. And meeting a people from worldwide, from countries that I don’t know was a very good experience. I guess this is the best contest for google. It is a Learning competition more than a race. Everyone is a mentor in glitter channel teaching me and I am a student…\n\nApologies :\n\nI apologize to my friends especially @sidhyatikku and many others for annoying them.Sorry …\n\nLink to my blog: vjmessi35.wixsite.com/vijaywebsite/blank-1/2018/01/11/GCI—JBOSS-COMMUNITY\n",
